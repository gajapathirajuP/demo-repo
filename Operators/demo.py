# Operators  ( operators are special symbols performs operations on variable and their values) manipulate data 

# There are diff type of operators  

# Arthimetic operators (+ - * /) Mathematical calculations

#Interpolation : This technique replaces place holders with actual value dynamically using f-strings (formatted string literals) use F with print and {}
#as place holders
