# Operators  ( operators are special symbols performs operations on variable and their values) manipulate data 

# There are diff type of operators  

# Arthimetic operators (+ - * /) Mathematical calculations
# // floor division (same as division but roudsoff the value)
# ** Exponentation (calculating the power)

#Interpolation : This technique replaces place holders with actual value dynamically using f-strings (formatted string literals) use F with print and {}
#as place holders

# to perform logical operations and mainluy used to check multiple conditions and results in boolean(True/False)
